# Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## Overview
This project compares multiple machine learning models to identify the **best-performing model** on a single dataset using standard evaluation metrics.

---

## Dataset
- Source: Sklearn Breast Cancer Dataset
- Binary classification problem

---

## Models Compared
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  
Results are stored in a comparison table and visualized using bar charts.


## Outcome
Learned how to compare models, detect overfitting, and select the best model for deployment.
